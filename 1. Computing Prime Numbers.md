## Problem 1
Write a program that computes and prints the 1000th prime number.

### Hints:
1. Initialize some state variables
2. Generate all (odd) integers > 1 as candidates to be prime
3. For each candidate integer, test whether it is prime
    1. One easy way to do this is to test whether any other integer > 1 evenly divides the candidate with 0 remainder. To do this, you can use modular arithmetic, for example, the expression a%b returns the remainder after dividing the integer a by the integer b.
    2. You might think about which integers you need to check as divisors – certainly you don’t need to go beyond the candidate you are checking, but   how much sooner can you stop checking?
4. If the candidate is prime, print out some information so you know where you are in the computation, and update the state variables
5. Stop when you reach some appropriate end condition. In formulating this condition, don’t forget that your program did not generate the first prime (2). 


```python
primeCount = 2
number = 3
primeNumber = 3
while primeCount < 1000:
    number = number + 2
    tempCount = 1
    for i in range(2, number):
        if number%i == 0:
            break
        else:
            tempCount = tempCount + 1
    if tempCount == (number - 1):
        primeCount = primeCount + 1
        primeNumber = number
print("1000th prime number is", primeNumber)
```

    1000th prime number is 7919
    

# The Product of the Primes

There is a cute result from number theory that states that for sufficiently large n the product of the primes less than n is less than or equal to e**n and that as n grows, this becomes a tight bound (that is, the ratio of the product of the primes to e**n gets close to 1 as n grows). <br/>
Computing a product of a large number of prime numbers can result in a very large number, which can potentially cause problems with our computation. So we can convert the product of a set of primes into a sum of the logarithms of the primes by applying logarithms to both parts of this conjecture. In this case, the conjecture above reduces to the claim that the sum of the logarithms of all the primes less than n is less than n, and that as n grows, the ratio of this sum to n gets close to 1.

## Problem 2
Write a program that computes the sum of the logarithms of all the primes from 2 to some number n, and print out the sum of the logs of the primes, the number n, and the ratio of these two quantities. Test this for different values of n.

### Hints:
While you should see the ratio of the sum of the logs of the primes to the value n slowly get closer to 1, it does not approach this limit monotonically.


```python
from math import *
n = int(input("Enter how many prime number you want to generate:"))
primeCount = 2
number = 3
primeNumber = 3
sumPrimeLog = log(2) + log(3)
ratio = 0
while primeCount < n:
    number = number + 2
    tempCount = 1
    for i in range(2, number):
        if number%i == 0:
            break
        else:
            tempCount = tempCount + 1
    if tempCount == (number - 1):
        primeCount = primeCount + 1
        primeNumber = number
        sumPrimeLog = sumPrimeLog + log(primeNumber)
        ratio = sumPrimeLog/primeNumber
print("sum of Prime Log =", sumPrimeLog, "||", "ratio =", ratio)
```

    Enter how many prime number you want to generate:230
    sum of Prime Log = 1396.447294437538 || ratio = 0.9624033731478553
